## Getting the most out of your pandas

Presentation at [PyConZA 2017](za.pycon.org).

Repository contents:

#### PyConZA_2017.ipynb 

This was the presentation I gave at the conference. It was intended to be run as a live presentation, using [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), but due to screen shape issues I ended up running through most of it as a normal jupyter notebook in the browser.

#### PyConZA_2017_annotated.ipynb 

The same content as the presentation notebook, but with extra explanatory notes.

#### simulate_loan_application_data.ipynb

A notebook for creating simulated loan application data suitable for importing in the presentation notebooks. I use real, but anonymised and scrambled, data during the presentation.
